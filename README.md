# Orbo

## What is it?

Orbo is a gravitational orbit simulator made in the Unity Game Engine. It simulates the orbiting of plants around a star, and showcases how orbits are impacted over a certain period of time, be it through collisions or just the sheer angle of the orbit itself. 

## How to use 

  1. Click download, and download the files in a zip file. 
  2. Extract the files into a premade folder. 
  3. Run the Orbo.exe file and have fun.

## What can I change in it?

- **The gravitional constant**
  - As the gravitational constant of 6.67E-11 is *WAY* too small for the Unity Engine to even show any impact, you have to add a multiplier. I personally recommend going with 30 to start off.
    
- **The amount of planets spawned**
  - You can change the amount of planets that you want to spawn in the field around the star, as this allows for collisions between the planets while they orbit. Don't get too crazy with it! 

- **The radius of the orbit** 
  - If you want to make the orbit of the planets be more wider, then go right ahead. This right here is for you. It can help you prevent the collisions that occur and maybe even see interesting elliptical orbits.
